<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is an university project about urban gardening. Among other things it provides the functionality to place virtual plants in your appartement or on your balcony. You can check whether you have enough space to get certain plants. Furthermore you can measure the size of AR- plants or change their height. This should help ease your way to grow your own plants and cultivate them.

Here's why:
* Today most people have very little space in big cities
* Growing your own plants can increase the perception of your environment
* Sustainability and a healthy life style become more and more important
